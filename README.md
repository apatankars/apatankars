Senior @ Brown building ML systems and teaching others to do the same. Head TA for Deep Learning because apparently I enjoy debugging gradient descent implementations. Previously worked on a multi-agent RL system, distributed systems that occasionally had all nodes up and running, and one very ambitious AI teaching assistant. Currently trying to figure out where next to explore :)
