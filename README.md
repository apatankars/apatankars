Sure! Here's a fun GitHub profile description:

👋 Hi there! I'm a **Brown University student** diving deep into the worlds of **Computer Science** and **International & Public Affairs**. When I'm not untangling neural networks, you can find me jamming out to my latest playlist, debating politics, or dreaming up ways to make the world a better place.

🌍 **Global thinker** with a passion for **code that matters**. From predicting earthquakes with RNNs to exploring the crossroads of tech and society, I'm all about projects that blend data, impact, and a bit of fun.

🎶 My repository is a mix of **ML magic**, **international intrigue**, and a dash of **musical inspiration**. If you're into tech with a side of humanity, you've come to the right place!

Let's connect, collaborate, and create something awesome together! 🚀
